      <h1>About</h1>

      <p>Samantha Sanders is a Portland-based mushroom cultivator and biomaterials researcher specializing in mycelium. 
        She has been growing her fungal material knowledge and experimentation since 2021 and has been surprised by 
        the seemingly endless possibilities the bio-fabrication space has to offer. 
        <br><br>
        Samantha is highly conscientious 
        of the environment, and wants to spread the importance of reducing waste through sharing biodegradable mycelial 
        forms with the world. With an aim to reduce negative stigmas against mushrooms, she hopes that exposing people to 
        mycelium will help them understand the complexity of the Fungal Kingdom.
        <br><br>
        Myterial World opens a window of exploration into the wonders yet to unfold.
